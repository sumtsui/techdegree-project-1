In this project, you'll create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. You can display a quote from a famous athlete, politician, or historical figure:

"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." â€” Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

You'll need to use your knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, including variables, loops and object literals, to complete this project.

To help you get started, we'll give you basic HTML and CSS, as well a JavaScript file containing some starter code. But you'll have to find the quotes yourself and build the data structure to store them in.

This project is a fun and effective way for you to practice fundamental JavaScript skills. It also gives you a simple interactive portfolio piece to show off your understanding of JavaScript.

When you're done, you'll put your finished project on GitHub, an important tool used by millions of developers to help share code and work collaboratively on programming projects. Creating and using a GitHub account is also a great way to share your work with potential employers.# techdegree-project-1
